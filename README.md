# ROS_RaspberryPi
Installing ROS on Raspberry-Pi may sometimes be helpful when one would like to run mobile robot (PR2 or Amigobot) using Raspberry-Pi. By searching online I found a link in ROS-Wiki page, an **.img** file with preinstalled ROS Kinetic in Ubuntu MATE. One just have to download this image and burn it into a formatted SD card. The link where this image is available is given below,
