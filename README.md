# ROS_RaspberryPi
Installing ROS on Raspberry-Pi may sometimes be helpful when one would like to run mobile robot (PR2 or Amigobot) using Raspberry-Pi. By searching online I found a link in ROS-Wiki page, an **.img** file with preinstalled ROS Kinetic in Ubuntu MATE. One just have to download this image and burn it into a formatted SD card. The link where this image is available can be found at http://www.german-robot.com/German-Robot.Com-Image-Pi3-ROS-Kinetic-Ubuntu-Mate.img.zip and its documentation  at http://www.german-robot.com/2016/05/26/raspberry-pi-sd-card-image/.

Afetr burning this image in to SD card, we need to modify language and keyboard settings of Ubuntu MATE as those settings are advantageous for those who knows German language. Next we will talk about the process of changinf language and keyborad layout.

For language change follow, system \rightarrow Preferences \rightarrow Personal \rightarrow Language Support
